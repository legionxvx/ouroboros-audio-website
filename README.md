Still under construction.

Development Map:
1) ~~Abandon template for bootstrap.~~
2) Incorporate responsive design.
* ~~Use *-fluid divs in most locations~~
* Comprehensive Viewport handling
* Compress media
* Navbar
* Javascript to help fill in the gaps
3) ~~Node.js or React app to show off skills.~~ (I may have jumped the gun on this part of the development plan... see https://github.com/legionxvx/yassp)
4) ?????.
5) Profit.
